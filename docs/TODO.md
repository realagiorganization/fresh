# TODO

## Completed Features ✅

**Core Functionality**: Event-driven architecture with unlimited undo/redo, multi-cursor editing, clipboard operations (copy/cut/paste), position history navigation (Alt+Left/Right), line wrapping, large file support (1GB+), instant startup.

**UI & Layout**: Split views (horizontal/vertical), scrollbar, tab bar, command palette (Ctrl+P), help system (Ctrl+H), file explorer with lazy loading and gitignore support, status bar, line numbers, themes (dark/light/high-contrast).

**LSP Integration**: Diagnostics (errors/warnings), code completion (Ctrl+Space), go-to-definition, rename refactoring (F2), multi-language support, process resource limits.

**File Operations**: Open/save/close, multiple buffers, file explorer (create/delete files/dirs, show/hide hidden, respect gitignore, auto-expand on focus, unsaved indicators), async I/O.

**Git Integration**: Git grep (Ctrl+Shift+G), git find file (Ctrl+Shift+P).

**Plugin System**: Lua 5.4 runtime, plugin manager, command registration, event hooks, async process spawning, buffer query API, overlay system. Example: TODO Highlighter plugin.

**Testing**: 400+ unit tests, 59 E2E tests, property-based tests, visual regression testing framework.

**Recent Fixes**: Scrollbar height when no scrolling needed, cursor rendering at buffer end, keybinding conflicts, file explorer scrolling and focus sync, viewport scrolling on Enter key, marker-based overlay system.

**Performance (Jan 2025)**: Massive improvements for huge files (61MB, 789K lines):
- **ChunkTree optimization**: Fixed chunk size from 64 bytes to 4KB → 38x speedup (file loading: 3.2s → 83ms, reduced tree from 1M to 15K nodes)
- **Scroll limit simplification**: O(n) → O(viewport_height), preventing problem at source rather than fixing afterward
- **Buffer cache removal**: Eliminated `buffer.to_string()` calls (3.9s for 61MB!), added TODO for proper incremental cache
- **render-line hook**: Plugins now inspect visible content during rendering (no duplicate iteration, scales to 1GB+ files)
- **Test performance**: `test_line_numbers_absolute_after_jump_to_beginning` improved from 158s → 0.10s (~1,580x speedup!)

- [ ] Read-only buffers (`editor.set_buffer_read_only(buffer_id, bool)`)
- [ ] Selection lists (`editor.show_selection_list(items, callback)`)
- [ ] Input dialogs (`editor.show_input(prompt, default, callback)`)
- [ ] Generic popups (`editor.show_popup(options)`)

#### Modal Interaction & Navigation

- [ ] Set buffer mode (`editor.set_mode(buffer_id, mode_name)`)
- [ ] Dynamic keybindings (`editor.bind_key(mode, key, callback)`)

- [ ] Set selection (`editor.set_selection(start, end)`)
- [ ] Scroll control (`editor.scroll_to_line(line_num)`)

#### Enhanced Hooks & Integration

- [ ] Undo history API: `editor.get_undo_history(...)`
- [ ] Custom syntax definitions
- [ ] Process cancellation/kill support
- [ ] Async Lua execution: `editor.async(function)`

#### Overlay Lifecycle Management
**Priority: High** (blocks TODO highlighter plugin from working correctly with text edits)

**Problem**: Marker-based overlays automatically adjust positions when text changes, but stale overlays aren't automatically removed. When text is inserted/deleted before existing keywords:
1. Old overlays persist with stale IDs (e.g., `todo_TODO_L1_O1`)
2. Markers move these overlays to new byte positions (correct!)
3. New overlays are created for the same keywords with new IDs (e.g., `todo_TODO_L2_O1`)
4. Result: Stale overlay highlights wrong content, new overlay highlights correct content

**Test failures**:
- `test_todo_highlighter_updates_on_edit` - inserting line before TODO leaves old overlay at wrong position
- `test_todo_highlighter_updates_on_delete` - deleting lines causes similar issue

**Solutions** (implement at least one):
- [ ] `editor.remove_overlays_by_prefix(buffer_id, prefix)` - Bulk remove plugin overlays by ID prefix
- [ ] `editor.clear_all_overlays(buffer_id)` - Clear all overlays for a buffer
- [ ] Automatic overlay cleanup based on marker validity (detect when marker points to deleted text)
- [ ] Overlay update API: `editor.update_overlay(buffer_id, overlay_id, new_range)` to reuse existing overlay

**Recommended approach**: Implement `remove_overlays_by_prefix()`. Plugins can then:
- On insert/delete events: `editor.remove_overlays_by_prefix(buffer_id, "todo_")`
- On next render-line: recreate overlays for visible keywords
- Still leverages markers for viewport scrolling (no recreation needed!)
- Only recreates when buffer content actually changes

## Technical Debt & Refactoring

### Line Wrapping Refactoring
- [ ] **Unify wrapping and no-wrapping code paths**: Treat no-wrapping as infinite-width wrapping
  - Modify rendering to always use `wrap_line()` with `WrapConfig::new(usize::MAX, gutter_width, false)` for no-wrap mode
  - Remove all `if line_wrap` branches in `split_rendering.rs::render_buffer_in_split()`
  - Handle horizontal scrolling as post-processing on the single segment returned for infinite-width lines

- [ ] **Move cursor position calculation into rendering traversal**: Eliminate duplicate line iteration
  - In `split_rendering.rs::render_buffer_in_split()`, track cursor screen position during the existing line rendering loop
  - As each line is rendered, check if it contains the primary cursor position
  - Use the already-computed `segments` from `wrap_line()` to calculate position via `char_position_to_segment()`
  - After loop completes, use tracked position instead of calling `viewport.cursor_screen_position()`
  - Delete `viewport.rs::cursor_screen_position()` entirely

- [ ] **Fix style preservation during wrapping**: Currently loses syntax highlighting/selection styles when wrapping
  - In wrapping section, preserve the original `line_spans` styling instead of using only first span's style
  - Track character-to-span mapping to apply correct styles to each character in wrapped segments
  - Ensure selections, syntax highlighting, and overlays render correctly across wrapped segments

**Benefits**: Single source of truth for wrapping, single line traversal (better performance), cursor positioning and rendering always agree by construction, massive code deduplication.

### Code Organization
- [x] Extract UI rendering (~430 lines → 6 modules)
- [x] Extract commands & prompts (~335 lines → 2 modules)
- [ ] Create BufferView abstraction (~500 lines)
- [ ] Extract multi-cursor operations (~200 lines)
- [ ] Refactor Editor into smaller components
- [ ] Split large modules (editor.rs is ~3000 lines)

### Test Infrastructure
- [ ] **Fix async file loading in test harness**: Currently 6 tests ignored due to async file loading not working properly
  - `test_file_explorer_displays_opened_file_content`
  - `test_git_find_file_actually_opens_file`
  - `test_git_grep_opens_correct_file_and_jumps_to_line`
  - `test_git_grep_cursor_position_accuracy`
  - `test_git_grep_shows_results`
  - Test harness needs way to wait for/force async file operations to complete

- [ ] **Fix BIG.txt generation timing**: 2 scrolling tests fail when run with other tests
  - `test_jump_to_eof_large_file`
  - `test_line_numbers_absolute_after_jump_to_beginning`
  - Issue: BIG.txt (61MB test file) generation interferes with other tests
  - Solution: Better test isolation or pre-generated fixtures

- [ ] **Support independent buffers per split**: Currently architectural limitation
  - `test_margin_per_buffer_in_split_view` expects different files in different splits
  - Current behavior: All splits display the same active buffer
  - Need to implement per-split buffer management if this is desired functionality

- [ ] Add more E2E tests for complex workflows
- [ ] Performance regression tests
- [ ] Memory leak detection tests
