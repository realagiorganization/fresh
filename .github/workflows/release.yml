# CI that:

# * checks for a Git Tag that looks like a release
# * builds artifacts with dist (archives, installers, hashes)
# * uploads those artifacts to temporary workflow zip
# * on success, uploads the artifacts to a GitHub Release
#
# Note that the GitHub Release will be created with a generated

# This task will run whenever you push a git tag that looks like a version
# like "1.0.0", "v0.1.0-prerelease.1", "my-app/0.1.0", "releases/v1.0.0", etc.
# Various formats will be parsed into a VERSION and an optional PACKAGE_NAME, where
# PACKAGE_NAME must be the name of a Cargo package in your workspace, and VERSION
# must be a Cargo-style SemVer Version (must have at least major.minor.patch).
#
# If PACKAGE_NAME is specified, then the announcement will be for that
# package (erroring out if it doesn't have the given version or isn't dist-able).
#
# If PACKAGE_NAME isn't specified, then the announcement will be for all
# (dist-able) packages in the workspace with that version (this mode is
# intended for workspaces with only one dist-able package, or with all dist-able
# packages versioned/released in lockstep).
#
# If you push multiple tags at once, separate instances of this workflow will
# spin up, creating an independent announcement for each one. However, GitHub
# will hard limit this to 3 tags per commit, as it will assume more tags is a
# mistake.
#
# If there's a prerelease-style suffix to the version, then the release(s)
# will be marked as a prerelease.
